\section{General Information}
\subsection{Purpose}
\paragraph{}The purpose of the Test Plan is to detail the testing process of the project. What to test, how to test each item, and when to test is discussed in detail below. 
\subsection{Scope}
\paragraph{}The first test plan will be to test the basic components of the game, making sure that key elements such as multiplayer are functional, as well as basic design concepts such as map generation, terrain, and physics. The first test plan will not involve "game balancing" concepts or detailed graphical testing.

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
\paragraph{}The game will be developed using the Unity game engine, using the Photon Unity Networking framework for enabling multiplayer design. C# will be used as our main coding language.
\subsection{Test Team}
\paragraph{}The project designers will supervise the testing process, acting as the leaders for the test team. Individuals unrelated to the creation of the project will be asked to test the game and provide insight on the basic testing elements that we are looking for. 
\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
\paragraph{}Some automated testing can also be done, through creation of certain functions in the code. For example, if we wished to test our map creation algorithm, we could write a function to automatically create 100 or more different maps and test to see if each one matched our requirements. 
\subsection{Testing Tools}
\paragraph{}We will use Unity as our testing tool, as well as use ourselves and peers to review the code and game to make sure everything is working as planned. We will also need at least two computers to test the networking and multiplayer capabilities, and a facility with internet access (such as a classroom).

\subsection{Proof of Concept Testing}
The Proof of Concept demo will be a game that supports multiplayer. Multiplayer will be handled with the Photon Unity Network framework. 
The game's menu will let players choose a server to join and then after successfully joining, they will be allowed to choose between using a Cat or a Mouse.
Players can use the w, a, s, and d keys to control the Cat or Mouse and should be able to interact with each other in a server.
