\section{General Information}
\subsection{Purpose}
\paragraph{}The purpose of the Test Plan is to detail the testing process of the project. What to test, how to test each item, and when to test is discussed in detail below. 
\subsection{Scope}
\paragraph{}The first test plan will be to test the basic components of the game, making sure that key elements such as multiplayer are functional, as well as basic design concepts such as map generation, terrain, and physics. The first test plan will not involve "game balancing" concepts or detailed graphical testing. 

\section{Plan}
	
\subsection{Software Description}
\paragraph{}The game will be developed using the Unity game engine, using the Photon Unity Networking framework for enabling multiplayer design. C\# will be used as our main coding language.
\subsection{Test Team}
\paragraph{}The project designers will supervise the testing process, acting as the leaders for the test team. Individuals outside of the development team will also be asked to test the game and provide insight on the basic testing elements which we are targeting. 
\subsection{Automated Testing Approach}
\paragraph{}Some automated testing can also be done, through creation of certain functions in the code. For example, if we wished to test our map creation algorithm, we could write a function to automatically create 100 or more different maps and test to see if each one matched our requirements. 
\subsection{Testing Tools}
\paragraph{}We will use Unity as our primary testing tool, utilising both members of the development team as well as outside testers to review the code and game to make sure everything is functioning as required. We will also need at least two computers  in order to test the networking and multiplayer capabilities, as well as a facility with Internet access (such as a classroom).
\subsection{Testing Schedule}
\paragraph{}The intended \textbf{Testing Schedule} is indicated below.

\end{tabularx}
\end{mdframed}

\subsection{Proof of Concept Testing}
The Proof of Concept demo will be a game that supports multiplayer. Multiplayer will be handled using the Photon Unity Network (PUN) framework for the Unity Game Engine. 
The game's menu will let players choose a server hosted on a network to connect to and, on success, will be able to see other players currently within the game session.

\paragraph{}
Players are able to use the mouse and keyboard to interact with other players and the map environment within a game match, through the server.
