\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Purpose of the Document}
\paragraph{}This document summarises the testing procedures, results, and analysis conducted on the \textbf{Cat-and-Mouse Game}. The approach and scope to the tests outlined in this report is as specified according to the accompanying \textbf{Test Plan}.

\subsection{Scope of the Testing}
\paragraph{}The tests which are conducted aim to verify that the basic components and systems of the product function as expected, as well as ensure that the \emph{interaction} between these various modules function as expected and defined within the \textbf.

\paragraph{}Tests will consist of two types: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Automated unit testing},  which consist of test functions performing some major task(s) within the Product, provided with a certain input, with the corresponding output being compared to an expected value. This will be  implemented using a test framework (such as \textbf{\emph{Unity Test Tools})}. These tests will be carried out primarily  through the performing a series of \emph{pre-defined} actions given a set \textbf{pre-condition} and an expected \textbf{post-condition}. These system tests cover all the modules of the Product: \emph{Character Behaviours}, \emph{Skill Behaviours}, \emph{Vitality Behaviours}, \emph{Win Conditions}, \emph{Physics}, \emph{Enemy Behaviours}, \emph{Menu/interface behaviour}
    \item \textbf{Usability Tests}, which consist of a User performing a set sequence of Actions in-game, while certain metrics relating to the \emph{usability} of the product is analysed using pre-defined \emph{quantitative} measures.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Organisation}
\paragraph{}As described above, this test report will consist of:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Section 1:} An Introduction to the overall aims, scope and methods utilised in the testing of this Product. 
    \item \textbf{Section 2:}  A description of the states, behaviours, and results measured from the System Tests, when given, as described above, a set pre-condition, a set of actions or behaviours carried out manually to change the state of the Product, and the resulting state's conformity to one or more expected post-conditions. This includes a description of the states, functions and results of the Automatic Unit Test Cases carried out.
    \item \textbf{Section 3:} A description of the states, behaviours, and results measured from the Usability Tests, described in more detail below.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Usability Testing}
\paragraph{}In addition, Usability Testing will be carried out in accordance with our \textbf{Test Plan}. These tests consist of subjective, non-functional and user-evaluated tests which measure the \emph{user experience} of the Product as whole, against certain pre-defined values for various aspects of the Product. This will then provide a quantitative measurement of the \emph{usability} of Product in relation to the scope defined above.
\paragraph{}\textbf{This will consist of the following tests:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Appearance Test}:  This will measure the \emph{ease of use} for Users to navigate the Interface by \emph{self-direction}, or without prior knowledge or experience with the Product.
    \item \textbf{Spelling and Grammar Test}:  This will measure the correctness of \emph{spelling} and \emph{grammar} with regards to the Textual Information which is presented to the User. This will include data such as Character Skill Data, on-screen prompts to the User regarding the availability of certain Actions when in a specified State, the information presented on the Multiplayer Lobby with regards to the current State of the Multiplayer Session, etc.
    \item \textbf{Control Test}: This will measure the \emph{time} and \emph{effort} required by a User to orientate themselves and become comfortable with the in-game controls.
    \item \textbf{Speed and Latency Test}: This will measure the Connection Quality when connected to the Multiplayer Server, in terms of average \emph{ping} values and \emph{bandwidth utilisation} over a set period of time. This will be measured as a User completes- a match within the game, as this will represent an overview of the sequence of Actions to be expected in production environments.
    \item \textbf{Graphical Frame Rate and Latency Test}: This will measure the \emph{frame-rate}, in Frames Per Second, and \emph{graphical latency} in Mill-seconds between each rendered frame. This test will be performed under the similar conditions as specified in the \textbf{Speed and Latency Test}, described above.
    \item \textbf{Fault Tolerance Test} This will measure the response provided to the User with regards to In-Game and Networking errors which may present itself during the normal operation of the product. This will include analysis of the \emph{effectiveness} of the Error Messages and/or prompts which are provided in assisting the User to remedy the issue with minimal \emph{time}, \emph{effort} and \emph{reference to external sources}.
    \item \textbf{Operational System Support Test}:  This will measure the range of support for various Hardware and Software Environments as defined in \textbf{The Design Document}. A fully-working copy of the Product will be installed on several test environments, and the ability of these environments to carry out common sequences of Actions in-game (such as connecting to a Multiplayer Lobby, starting a new Match on the Multiplayer Server, and utilising Skills).
    
    \item \textbf{Graphical API Support Test}: This will measure the support for industry-standard graphical Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), such as environments supporting \emph{DirectX 9}, \emph{DirectX 11} and \emph{OpenGL}. This can be verified through the observation of any rendering failure and graphical artifacts which may present itself during the operation of the product.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \section{Automatic Unit Testing}
    \subsection{Overview}
    \paragraph{} The \textbf{Unity Engine} and the associated \textbf{Unity Test Tools Asset Library} facilitates the design of a highly-automated test environment.
    
    \subsection{Methodology}
    \paragraph{} \textbf{Pre-Conditions} and \textbf{Post-Conditions} may be specified and compared using \emph{assert} specifications and invariants to verify adherence to a (range of) expected output values and states. The Unity Test Tools utilises a \emph{model-based} testing approach, which allows for \emph{Testing Scripts} to be attached to \textbf{GameObjects} and access any associated \emph{behavioural scripts}. Functions can then be defined within the Testing Scripts, as well as the Unity Inspector itself, which then conducts a comparison of a the value of a specified variable within the behaviour script (such as \emph{currentHealth}, for instance), to a set of expected values as defined in a post-condition.
    
    \subsection{Scope} 
    \paragraph{}The Scope of these Automatic Unit Tests should cover major Functions and Methods defined within each Module of the product, as well as any Interfaces present to allow for defined interactions \textbf{between} these Modules.
    
    \subsection{Execution of Test Cases}
    \paragraph{} The execution of the Test cases will be through the \emph{Run Tests} buttons provided within the Unit Tester Interface, a part of the Unity Test Tools in the Inspector Window of the Unity Integrated Development Environment.
    
    \subsection{Retrieval of Test Results} 
    \paragraph{}The results of the Unit Tests will be displayed through an Indicator (displaying a result of either \emph{Pass}, or \emph{Fail}) within the Unit Tester Interface, as described in the \textbf{Execution of Test Cases} section above.
    
    \subsection{Analysis of Test Results}
    \paragraph{} The results of the Unit Tests will be analysed primarily based on the return of a \emph{Pass} or \emph{Fail} property, as the objective nature of Unit Testing does not allow for any \emph{variance} in the actual result from the expected results, when given a certain set of Inputs. Should a test return \emph{failure}, then, assuming that the \textbf{pre-condition} and the \emph{input to change state} holds, then it can be deduced that the Action or Behaviour under observation is \emph{not} operating as expected.
    
    \subsection{Movement Input Tests}
    \subsubsection{Test 3.1.1.1 to Test  3.1.1.4: Walk in a direction, starts from stationary Test}
    \paragraph{}\textbf{void FixedUpdate()}
    \paragraph{} Checks user input for necessary keys for movement, changes movement speed, attack power, checks if user can move.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Pre-Conditions:} User must be in a game, after joining the lobby and selecting a room and have the game start.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Test Inputs:} A keyboard so that the user can press keys, which FixedUpdate() will check for. For these tests, the keys 'w','a','s','d' will be checked by the function FixedUpdate(). 
    \paragraph{Expected Results:} If the user pressed 'w' on their keyboards for 1 second, the user controlled character will move forward from a stationary position for a second. If 's', user controlled character will move backwards from a stationary position for a second. If 'a', user controlled character will move to the left from a stationary position for a second. If 'd', user controlled character will move to the right from a stationary position for a second.
    \paragraph{Actual Results:} \textbf{Passed}. The character the user controls will move to a direction given by the user when the character starts from a stationary position.
    \paragraph{Analysis of Performance:} The \emph{pass} result from this Test Case indicates given input from the user does indeed cause the character to move to the intended direction from a stationary state. This test case is not expected to involve any considerable performance measurements.
    \paragraph{Functional Requirements:} Requirement 8
    \paragraph{MIS Component:} Mouse, Cat 
    
    \subsubsection{Test 3.1.1.5: Continuous movement in one direction, when the same key is held down}
    \paragraph{}\textbf{void FixedUpdate()}
    \paragraph{} Checks user input for necessary keys for movement, changes movement speed, attack power, checks if user can move.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Pre-Conditions:} User must be in a game, after joining the lobby and selecting a room and have the game start.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Test Inputs:} A keyboard so that the user can press and hold keys, which FixedUpdate() will check for. For this test, the keys 'w','a','s','d' will be checked by the function FixedUpdate(). 
    \paragraph{Expected Results:} If the user holds down either 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd' on their keyboards, the character will continue moving in the direction of the key held, and will stop if the key is released.
    \paragraph{Actual Results:} \textbf{Passed}. The character controlled does move to the given input's direction until the button is released. 
    \paragraph{Analysis of Performance:} The \emph{pass} result from this Test Case indicates that the user is able to move their characters in a given input's direction for however long the button was held for. This test case is not expected to involve any considerable performance measurements.
    \paragraph{Functional Requirements:} Requirement 8
    \paragraph{MIS Component:} Mouse, Cat 
    
    \subsubsection{Test 3.1.1.6: Jump, while standing still}
    \paragraph{}\textbf{void FixedUpdate()}
    \paragraph{} Checks user input for necessary keys for movement, changes movement speed, attack power, checks if user can move.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Pre-Conditions:} User must be in a game, after joining the lobby and selecting a room and have the game start.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Test Inputs:} A keyboard so that the user can press keys, which FixedUpdate() will check for. For this test, the space key (when user presses the space button) will be checked by the function FixedUpdate(). 
    \paragraph{Expected Results:} If the user pressed the spacebar, the character will perform a jump action (so their Y axis velocity is increased, and then they drop back down to the ground after a while)
    \paragraph{Actual Results:} \textbf{Passed}. The character performed a jump action after user hit the spacebar key.
    \paragraph{Analysis of Performance:} Although the character does change they Y axis position during the jump action for a specified amount of time, certain tests have shown us that the character jumps higher than expected. These instances are rare, and as such the result is still satisfactory. This test case is not expected to involve any considerable performance measurements.
    \paragraph{Functional Requirements:} Requirement 8
    \paragraph{MIS Component:} Mouse, Cat 
    
    \subsubsection{Test 3.1.1.7: Jump, while already in motion in a given direction}
    \paragraph{}\textbf{void FixedUpdate()}
    \paragraph{} Checks user input for necessary keys for movement, changes movement speed, attack power, checks if user can move.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Pre-Conditions:} User must be in a game, after joining the lobby and selecting a room and have the game start.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Test Inputs:} A keyboard so that the user can press keys, which FixedUpdate() will check for. For this test, the space key (when user presses the space button) and directional keys ('w','a','s','d') will be checked by the function FixedUpdate(). 
    \paragraph{Expected Results:} If the user is currently moving their character in a direction using the keys 'w','a','s','d' (with the keys being held), and then presses the space key, the character should be performing a jump action towards the direction it was going before the jump key was hit. 
    \paragraph{Actual Results:} \textbf{Passed}. The character jumps towards the direction they are going in.
    \paragraph{Analysis of Performance:} The \emph{pass} result from this Test Case indicates that the user was able to have their character perform a jump action that is going in a certain direction. This test case is not expected to involve any considerable performance measurements.
    \paragraph{Functional Requirements:} Requirement 8
    \paragraph{MIS Component:} Mouse, Cat 
    
    \subsubsection{Test 3.1.1.8: A change in direction}
    \paragraph{}\textbf{void FixedUpdate()}
    \paragraph{} Checks user input for necessary keys for movement, changes movement speed, attack power, checks if user can move.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Pre-Conditions:} User must be in a game, after joining the lobby and selecting a room and have the game start.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Test Inputs:} A keyboard so that the user can press and hold keys, which FixedUpdate() will check for. For this test, the keys 'w','a','s','d' will be checked by the function FixedUpdate(). 
    \paragraph{Expected Results:} If the user is currently moving the character in one direction (button held), and then tries to move them in another, the the result would be that the character moves in the direction of the 2 buttons being held. For example if the forward button is held (key 'w'), and the left button is held (key 'a'), then the character will move diagonally to the left.  
    \paragraph{Actual Results:} \textbf{Passed}. The intended behaviour takes place when 2 directional keys are held.
    \paragraph{Analysis of Performance:} The \emph{pass} result from this Test Case indicates that the user is able to move their characters in a direction determined by the two buttons being held. This test case is not expected to involve any considerable performance measurements.
    \paragraph{Functional Requirements:} Requirement 8
    \paragraph{MIS Component:} Mouse, Cat 
    
    \subsubsection{Test 3.1.1.9: Returning to a stationary position, when originally in motion}
    \paragraph{}\textbf{void FixedUpdate()}
    \paragraph{} Checks user input for necessary keys for movement, changes movement speed, attack power, checks if user can move.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Pre-Conditions:} User must be in a game, after joining the lobby and selecting a room and have the game start. Also, directional buttons must be held down as well (to indicate the character is in motion). 
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Test Inputs:} A keyboard so that the user can press and hold keys, which FixedUpdate() will check for. For this test FixedUpdate will check for when no keys are being pressed.
    \paragraph{Expected Results:} If the user's character was currently in motion and then releases all/any key being held down, then the character will stop moving.
    \paragraph{Actual Results:} \textbf{Passed}. Characters will stop moving as soon as all/any key being held down are released. 
    \paragraph{Analysis of Performance:} The \emph{pass} result from this Test Case indicates that the user was able to stop their character from moving by releasing all/any keys being held down. When this was testing on an ice platform, the character will take a small amount of time to stop completely (as expected from moving on ice). This test case is not expected to involve any considerable performance measurements.
    \paragraph{Functional Requirements:} Requirement 8
    \paragraph{MIS Component:} Mouse, Cat 
    
    \subsection{Camera Input Tests}

    \paragraph{Actual Results:} \textbf{Passed}. When the user moves their mouse up or down, the camera looks to the corresponding direction. 
    \paragraph{Analysis of Performance:} The \emph{pass} result from this Test Case indicates that the user was able to get the camera to look where they moved their mouse to. This test case is not expected to involve any considerable performance measurements.
    \paragraph{Functional Requirements:} Requirement 7
    \paragraph{MIS Component:} Mouse, Cat
    
    \subsubsection{Test 3.1.2.5: Camera rotation across multiple axis at once}
    \paragraph{}\textbf{void CamControls()}
    \paragraph{} Checks for user mouse input and will keep track of X and Y axis changes when the mouse is being moved. Enables rotation of the camera depending on how the mouse is moved.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Pre-Conditions:} User must be in a game, after joining the lobby and selecting a room and have the game start.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Test Inputs:} A mouse that the user can move so that CamControls() can keep track of X and Y axis values.
    \paragraph{Expected Results:} If the user moves their mouse 1/2 inch fowards and to the left, then 1/2 inch forwards and to the right, then 1/2 inch backwards and to the left, then finally 1/2 inch backwards to the right, then the camera should rotate 30 degrees counterclockwise along the Y axis, 30 degrees backwards along the X axis, then 30 degrees backwards along the X axis, then 30 degrees counterclockwise along the Y axis, then 30 degrees forwards along the X axis, then 30 degrees clockwise along the Y axis, and finally 30 degrees forwards along the X axis.

    \paragraph{Analysis of Performance:} The \emph{pass} result from this Test Case indicates that the user was able to get the camera to look where they moved their mouse to. This test case is not expected to involve any considerable performance measurements.
    \paragraph{Functional Requirements:} Requirement 7
    \paragraph{MIS Component:} Mouse, Cat
    
    \subsubsection{Test 3.1.2.6 to Test 3.1.2.7: Maximum camera rotation along the X axis, upwards/downwards}
    \paragraph{}\textbf{void CamControls()}
    \paragraph{} Checks for user mouse input and will keep track of X and Y axis changes when the mouse is being moved. Enables rotation of the camera depending on how the mouse is moved.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Pre-Conditions:} User must be in a game, after joining the lobby and selecting a room and have the game start.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Test Inputs:} A mouse that the user can move so that CamControls() can keep track of X and Y axis values.
    \paragraph{Expected Results:} If the user moves their mouse upwards as much as they can, the camera will stop when the rotation degree is 90 upwards. If the user moves their mouse downwards as much as they can, then camera will stop rotation when the rotation is 90 degrees downwards
    \paragraph{Actual Results:} \textbf{Passed}. The camera will eventually stop following the user's mouse when moving up or down after max degree value is reached.
    \paragraph{Analysis of Performance:} The \emph{pass} result from this Test Case indicates that the camera stopped when it had reached its bound when the user is looking up or down. This test case is not expected to involve any considerable performance measurements.

    \paragraph{}\textbf{Test Inputs:} A keyboard so that the user can press and hold keys, which FixedUpdate() will check for. For these tests, user will have the move the character and run into different game objects. 
    \paragraph{Expected Results:} For the collision test with the ground, when the user moves around, they should not fall below the ground. For the collision test with a wall, the character should not go through the wall and must be stopped by the wall. For the collision test with stationary objects, the character should stop moving once they hit said objects. For collision test with another player's character, the character should stop moving once they hit the second character. 
    \paragraph{Actual Results:} \textbf{Passed}. The character successfully passed the first two test. The character did not stop once they hit a stationary object (such as a ball) or a player, but they did experience collision as they moved the object/player with them as they moved.
    \paragraph{Analysis of Performance:} The \emph{pass} result from this Test Case indicates that the user's character can experience collision with different game objects in the game environment. This test case is not expected to involve any considerable performance measurements.

    \paragraph{}\textbf{Pre-Conditions:} Three users must be connected to the same Match, and at the same location within the Map Environment. Two of these users must be on the same Team, while the remaining user is on the Opposing Team to these first two users. There is also an Environment-Controlled (AI) Character at that location.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Test Inputs:} The users on the same team uses Regular Attacks and Skills targeted at each other. The users on two different teams uses Regular Attacks and Skills targeted at each other. One of the users  uses Regular Attacks and Skills targeted at the AI character.
    \paragraph{Expected Results:} The users on the same team do not cause any negative effects to the attributes of each others' Characters. The users from different teams do cause negative effects to the attributes of each others' Characters. The user do cause negative effects to the attributes of the AI Character.
    \paragraph{Actual Results:} The attacks by users on the same team do not affect any attributes of each others' Characters. The attacks by users from different teams led to a decrease in the Health Points (HP) of the attacked Character. The attack by a user on the AI Character does led to a decrease in the HP of the AI Character.

In the case of characterDie(), the AI character may be respawned within the Map Environment after a set period of time.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Pre-Conditions:} Two users must be connected to the same Match, and at the same location within the Map Environment. Both users must be from different Teams. There is also an Environment-Controlled (AI) Character at that location.
    \paragraph{}\textbf{Test Inputs:} One of the users uses Regular Attacks and Skills targeted at the AI Character, until their Health Point value reaches 0. Then, both users uses Regular Attacks and Skills targeted at each other, until one of the users' Health Point value reaches 0.
    \paragraph{Expected Results:} The AI Character will be unable to interact with entities within the Map Environment, and the victorious user is granted a set number of Experience Points and Match Points. After a set period of time, the AI Character respawns at its set location. The defeated user will be unable to interact with entities within the Map Environment, and the victorious user is granted a set number of Experience Points and Match Points. After a set period of time, the defeated user will be removed from the Map Environment and returned to the Match Room Screen.
    \paragraph{Actual Results:} Upon reaching a Health Point value of 0, the AI Monster becomes unable to interact with the map environment and the victorious player is granted a set amount of Experience Points and Match Points. Upon reaching a Health Point value of 0, the defeated user is taken out of the Map Environment and returned to the Match Room Screen. The victorious player is granted a set amount of Experience Points and Match Points.
    \paragraph{Analysis of Performance:} The \emph{pass} result from this Test Case indicates the quality of the connection between users (clients) and the Multiplayer Server is sufficient to prevent any match-terminating errors.
    \paragraph{Functional Requirements:} Requirement 9, Requirement 10, Requirement 15
    \paragraph{MIS Component:} Mouse, Cat, Maze, Abilities, Skill, Vitality, NetworkManager
    
    \subsubsection{Test 3.1.3.12: Environmental Effects Test}
